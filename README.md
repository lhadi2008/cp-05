Instructions
Instructions:

Import the Numpy library.
Ask the user to enter the number of students and the number of subjects.
Create a Numpy array to store the marks of each student in each subject. The array should have the shape (number of students, number of subjects).
Ask the user to enter the marks of each student in each subject.
Calculate the total marks for each student using the sum() function of Numpy.
Calculate the percentage for each student using the total marks and the formula: percentage = (total marks / (number of subjects * 100)) * 100
Calculate the grade for each student using the percentage and the following grading system:
90% or above: A+
80% or above: A
70% or above: B+
60% or above: B
50% or above: C
below 50%: F
Display the result for each student in a tabular format with columns for student name, total marks, percentage, and grade.
Note:

Evaluation Specifics

Your instructor will evaluate your checkpoint based on the criterias mentioned below. All criteria are rated from 0 to 5

 Checkpoint Criteria

Input: The program must prompt the user to enter the number of students and the number of subjects, and to input the marks of each student in each subject. It must handle errors gracefully, such as non-numeric input.
Output: The program must display the result for each student in a tabular format with columns for student name, total marks, percentage, and grade. The output should be well-formatted and easy to read.
Numpy: The program must use Numpy to store and manipulate the marks data as arrays. It should use the sum() function to calculate the total marks, and the np.where() function to apply the grading system and calculate the grades.
Logic Flow: The program must have a clear and logical flow of execution, starting from the input prompts, through the calculations and grading, and ending with the output display. It should be easy to follow and understand, with comments to explain each step.
